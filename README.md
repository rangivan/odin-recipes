Odin-Project-Recipes
This project will involve creating a webpage for a recipes directory.
We will create a standard boilerplate 
There are three Iterations for this project
Iteration 1. Will involve creating a index.html in the odin-recipes directory. Followed by a boilerplate where we wil be adding a h1 heading 'Odin Recipes'
Iteration 2: Recipe Page
    1. create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory 1.named 'recipes'
    2.create a ne HTML file within the recipes directory and it will be named after the recipe it will contain. This project will use 'No_Bean_Low_Carb_Chili'
    3.heading will be the recipe name
    4.We will then link this recipe page to our index.html file 
Iteration 3:Recipe Page ContenT 
    THe page will include the following content:
    1.An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading.
    2.Under the image we will include a description heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
    3.Under the description we will also add an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe. This will be labeled 'Ingredients' (heading will be used)
    4.Under the ingredients list we will add a ordered list labeled 'Steps'of the steps needed for making the dish. 'Steps' - will be a heading 
Iteration 4: We will add two more recipes with identical page structures as our first recipe page
    All three recipes will be linked on the index page
    Links to those pages will be in an unordered list so that they aren't all on one line
